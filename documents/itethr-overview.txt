iTethr Overview – First Generation
🌎 Overview
iTethr is a next-generation community infrastructure platform designed for international
students, organizations, creators, and global users to build structured communities, offer
services, and interact through real-time social engagement tools.
The First Generation of iTethr focuses on a high-impact, scalable MVP with deeply integrated AI
features, modular spaces, and a core trust-driven social layer.
This document outlines the full backend architecture, data flows, modules, user journey, and
developer integration blueprint.
🌎 User Account System
✅ Supported Sign-Up Methods
 Sign Up with Google (OAuth2)
 Sign Up with Apple (OAuth2)
 Sign Up with Email + Password (Default Path)
🌎 Email Sign-Up Flow
iTethr simplifies the login and onboarding process to minimize friction. Users are onboarded
through a quick 3-step setup, with progressive profile building handled later from the profile
screen.
1. 2. 3. Step 1: Enter Username, Password, (required)
Step 2: Select Gender (optional), Date of Birth (required)
Step 3: Interests Selection (optional), Accept Privacy Policy (required)
After completing onboarding, users land directly in Home with access to their private
‘You’ chat and any pre-joined community. Full profile customization and setup can be
done gradually afterward.
🌐 Identity Fields Stored
username (unique, lowercase), password_hash, dob, gender (optional) privacy_accepted:
true, joined_at, last_active , auth_method (email/google/apple)
🌐 Home Interface Layout
iTethr introduces a revolutionary and unconventional design that breaks away from traditional
social apps. Ditching the standard navigation bar, iTethr uses a bubble-based interface that is
spatial, intuitive, and visually engaging.
Instead of navigating through tabs, users interact with floating animated bubbles that represent
their Communities, Loops, and Contacts. It creates an immersive sense of presence rather than
just movement between screens.
🌎 Key UI Elements:
 Top Left: Profile icon for account settings
 Top Right: Notifications and Marketplace
 Bottom Center: A persistent Smart Search bar that lets users ask questions or interact
with Aeono AI anytime
 Center Bubble UI: Interactive floating circles for Communities, Loops, and Tethr
connections
 Floating Create Button: For instantly launching new Posts, Loops, Hubs, or Communities
This novel layout doesn’t just look different it feels different. It’s designed for flow,
freedom, and meaningful discovery. A digital landscape where users move naturally
between moments of interaction, without relying on static menus or navigation tabs.
🌐 Spaces Architecture (Global Navigation)
Users land inside a three-space architecture:
1. Home Space
 Community Circles joined
 Circles and Community feeds
 Private Chats (1-on-1)
 “You” – a self-chat space for journaling, notes, and drafts
2. Global Space
 iFeed (Global feed - Tethrs / Global tabs)
 Loops (Real-time trending discussion threads)
3. Favourite Space
 Pinned: Rooms, Community Plus, Communities, Spaces, Loops
 Fully user customizable
➕ Create Button (Action Center)
Users can create:
 Post
 Community Plus (+)
 Hub (Standard)
Rooms cannot be created directly, they are created only inside Hubs (single-layer) or
within a Community Plus by admins.
 Loop (Mood expression)
 Space (Personal/Creator)
Events & Services are created inside the Marketplace module.
🌐 User Profiles
iTethr users are at the center of the ecosystem. Whether you’re a student, freelancer, creator,
or organization member, your profile reflects your identity, reputation, and contributions.
Each user has a card-style profile that showcases their key identity attributes and engagement
stats. Alongside their username, every user also has a unique Personal ID, which is more
reliable and permanent than usernames. This Personal ID ensures long-term discoverability,
smart search indexing, and future-proof scaling.
Users can also verify their identity to receive role-specific verification badges such as Student,
Professional, or Freelancer. This helps build credibility and enhances visibility across the
platform.
🌎 Personal Profile
 Name, Bio, Location, Skills, Interests
 Tethrd Level – a dynamic score based on your engagement
 Trust Score – a system-generated credibility score
 Your posts, offered services, and endorsements from others
 Unique Personal ID and Username (both searchable)
 Public profile link for sharing outside the platform
 Optional verification badge (Student / Freelancer / Professional)
On iTethr, if User A finds User B, they can send a Tethr Request to connect. There are two types
of Tethr paths:
 If User B has a public profile, Tethring happens instantly
 If User B requires approval, they must accept the request to complete the connection
Once User A and B are Tethred:
 They can view each other’s full profile
 They can send private messages
 They can request help or offer services
Tethring is not like ‘follow’ or ‘follow back’ it’s a mutual, consent-based connection system
designed for meaningful interactions.
Profiles are discoverable via Aeono and connected across iTethr’s features from chats to
marketplace and beyond.
🌎 Business Profile
Business Profiles are designed for official organizations such as agencies, NGOs, and universities
that want to offer services, host events, or manage communities on iTethr.
 Full organization bio with structured details (description, contact info, purpose)
 Logo, Banner, and team role assignments
 Showcase active and past service listings
 Publish and manage events
 Add external links to their website, social profiles, or other platforms
 Manage and moderate Communities or Hubs under their domain
 Verified label indicating their institutional or agency-level status
🌎 iFeed: Global Content Feed
iFeed is iTethr’s dynamic global content stream functioning like a fusion of Reddit and X
(Twitter). It serves as the main space where public posts, announcements, and Loop discussions
are surfaced and shared globally. Users can like, comment, share, and save posts for
engagement and follow-up.
 Two Tabs: Tethrs (Network posts) & Global
 AI-curated based on:
o User interests
o Engagement behavior
o Loop activity
🌐 Community System
🌎 Community Plus (+)
A multi-layered organizational structure for universities, national communities, NGOs, or large
organizations. A Community Plus contains multiple Hubs (departments, sub-community) which
in turn contain Rooms (chat/feed/event units).
Example Structure:
 Community Plus → University of Latvia
o Hub → Department of Computer Science
 Room → AI Enthusiasts
In this structure:
 The Community Plus represents the entire university.
 Each Hub can represent a department, student organization, or cultural group.
 Rooms inside the Hub can be used by class batches, project teams, or working
groups. a university or large organization owns a Community Plus, which contains
various Hubs (Standard) (based on departments, regions, or interests), and each
Hub can host multiple
Rooms (chat, feed, events).

🌎 Loops (Threads)
Loops are real-time, emotion-driven or topic-triggered micro-posts that spark spontaneous
discussions across the platform. They are designed to encourage instant engagement, raise
problems, express moods, or start conversations that can quickly gain visibility.
 Anyone can create a Loop when they’re bored, frustrated, inspired, or want to start a
topic
 Loops can be shared inside Communities and Hubs
 All Loops are pushed to the Global > Loops feed for maximum visibility
 AI surfaces trending or contextually relevant Loops
 Often used for spontaneous group discussions, live debates, or public calls for help
 Expire naturally or are de-prioritized by AI over time
🌐 Chat System
The Chat System in iTethr works similarly to other modern messaging platforms, but with
powerful enhancements for both private and community contexts.
Community/Room Chat
 Real-time messaging with typing indicators
 Reactions, Quote replies, Polls
 File sharing, Image/video/media upload
 Pinned messages for announcements
 Integrated with Room feeds and events
Private Chat

participants
WebSocket or Firebase integration required for real-time operations.
❗ Notification Engine
The Notification Engine ensures users are always aware of key actions and responses across the
platform — from new community invites to Loop replies. It uses AI-based grouping for relevance
and avoids overload by enabling mute settings per category.
 Categories:
o Community Approvals
o Tethr Requests
o Events & Reminders
o Marketplace activity
o Loop replies
 AI grouping + mute per category

🌐 Sample User Flow
iTethr is designed to onboard users quickly and intentionally. Unlike other platforms that
overload users immediately after login, iTethr ensures a clean, minimal entry. Users only
experience their private chat space (“You”) and any Community they’ve been invited to
everything else unfolds based on engagement.
Users can customize or build their profile gradually, allowing them to focus on connection first,
and setup later. This phased approach ensures better user retention and deeper discovery over
time.
